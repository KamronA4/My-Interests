# Overview
This folder is about my process learning about the GMRES
(Generalized Minimal RESiduals) algorithm. Essentially, GMRES
is an algorithm that solves the least squares problem for a linear
system Ax = b using an iterative technique.

## Background

### Krylov Subspace and Cayley Hamilton

## Derivation

### Arnoldi Process


## Convergence Criterion


## Restarted GMRES
